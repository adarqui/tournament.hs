--
-- The Tournament structure contain a Map of 'GameId' -> 'Game' for its internal
-- representation and the 'GameId' keys are the location in the Tournament.
--
-- Duel tournaments are based on the theory from <http://clux.org/entries/view/2407>.
-- By using the seeding definitions listed there, there is almost only one way to
-- generate a tournament, and the ambivalence appears only in Double elimination.
--
-- We have additionally chosen that brackets should converge by having the losers bracket move upwards.
-- This is not necessary, but improves the visual layout when presented in a standard way.
--
-- FFA tournaments use a collection of sensible assumptions on how to
-- optimally split n people into s groups while minimizing the sum of seeds difference
-- between groups for fairness. At the end of each round, groups are recalculated from the scores
-- of the winners, and new groups are created for the next round.

-- TODO: This structure is meant to encapsulate this structure to ensure internal consistency,
-- but hopefully in such a way it can be safely serialized to DBs.
